This repository contains examples of small projects or tests using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS occasionally.

In many cases, some inspiration was used as a base, and when I remember I have cited that inspiration.

All of these were tested and working in Firefox, and in most cases, there is no vendor-specific CSS used.
